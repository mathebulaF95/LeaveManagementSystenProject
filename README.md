About my leave management system
This online leave management system enable the admin to login, to manage employees, to see employees which request the leave, add and remove employees, approve/decline the leave, and change the password.
It also allows employees to login, update the profile, change password, apply for a leave, check the leave history and status. I have used SQL database which stores the employee's information after applying for a leave, and admin login details 

How to run my project
